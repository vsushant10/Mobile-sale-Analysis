# Mobile-sale-Analysis Power BI
This project showcases my first Power BI dashboard, where I have analyzed mobile sales data for different city regions in India. Using dummy data spanning 2021 to 2024, the dashboard provides insights into sales trends by month, transaction volumes, and regional performance.

To visualize the data effectively, I incorporated various Power BI chart types, including line charts, funnel charts, pie charts, and bar charts. Additionally, I utilized DAX functions to create month-to-date (MTD) reports and year-over-year (YoY) comparisons (T-12).

This project demonstrates my ability to work with Power BI to build insightful, interactive dashboards and leverage DAX for advanced analytical calculations.
